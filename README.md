# DS_Hashmap
-I was supposed to input a string which may consist of
i. Lower case alphabets (a-z)
ii. Upper case alphabets (A-Z)
iii. Spaces
iv. Numbers (0-9)
v. Special characters like,! , - ,â€¦ etc.
- I was supposed to find out which character occurs the maximum number of times and the
number of its occurrence, in the given string. If two characters occur an equal number of
times, I had to output the character with the lower ASCII code.
I was supposed to deal with any string whose maximum length can be 1000 characters.
I had to use hashing and build My own hash table in my algorithm.
Input format:
The input will contain a string.
Output format:
I had to output two things which will be separated by a space:
i) The character which occurs the maximum number of times.
ii) The number of its occurrence.
Sample input
